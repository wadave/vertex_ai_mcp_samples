    "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that simplifies how AI assistants connect with external data, tools, and systems. It achieves this by standardizing the way applications provide contextual information to Large Language Models (LLMs), creating a vital interface for models to interact directly with various external services.\n",

       "-Tool-: What is the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span>?<p>The <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span>, also called <span class=\"qt0\">influenza</span>, is a respiratory infection caused by viruses. Each year, millions of Americans get sick with the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span>. Sometimes it causes mild illness. But it can also be serious or even deadly, especially for people over 65, newborn babies, and people with certain chronic illnesses.</p>What causes the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span>?<p>The <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> is caused by <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> viruses that spread from person to person. When someone with the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> coughs, sneezes, or talks, they spray tiny droplets. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby. Less often, a person may get <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> by touching a surface or object that has <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.</p>What are the symptoms of the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span>?<p>Symptoms of the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> come on suddenly and may include:</p><ul><li>Fever or feeling feverish/chills</li><li>Cough</li><li>Sore throat</li><li>Runny or stuffy nose</li><li>Muscle or body aches</li><li>Headaches</li><li>Fatigue (tiredness)</li></ul><p>Some people may also have vomiting and diarrhea. This is more common in children.</p><p>Sometimes people have trouble figuring out whether they have a cold or the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span>. There are differences between them:</p>Signs and SymptomsColdFluStart of symptomsSlowlySuddenlyFeverRarelyUsuallyAchesSometimes (slight)UsuallyFatigue, weaknessSometimesUsuallyHeadacheRarelyCommonStuffy nose, sneezing, or sore throatCommonSometimes<p>Sometimes people say that they have a <span class=\"qt0\">\"flu\"</span> when they really have something else. For example, <span class=\"qt0\">\"stomach flu\"</span> isn't the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span>; it's gastroenteritis.</p>What other problems can the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> cause?<p>Some people who get the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> will develop complications. Some of these complications can be serious or even life-threatening. They include:</p><ul><li>Bronchitis</li><li>Ear infection</li><li>Sinus infection</li><li>Pneumonia</li><li>Inflammation of the heart (myocarditis), brain (encephalitis), or muscle tissues (myositis, rhabdomyolysis)</li></ul><p>The <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> also can make chronic health problems worse. For example, people with asthma may have asthma attacks while they have <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span>.</p><p>Certain people are more likely to have complications from the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span>, including:</p><ul><li>Adults 65 and older</li><li>Pregnant women</li><li>Children younger than 5</li><li>People with certain chronic health conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease</li></ul>How is the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> diagnosed?<p>To diagnose the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span>, health care providers will first do a medical history and ask about your symptoms. There are several tests for the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span>. For the tests, your provider will swipe the inside of your nose or the back of your throat with a swab. Then the swab will be tested for the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> virus.</p><p>Some tests are quick and give results in 15-20 minutes. But these tests are not as accurate as other <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> tests. These other tests can give you the results in one hour or several hours.</p>What are the treatments for the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span>?<p>Most people with the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> recover on their own without medical care. People with mild cases of the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> should stay home and avoid contact with others, except to get medical care.</p><p>But if you have symptoms of <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> and are in a high risk group or are very sick or worried about your illness, contact your health care provider. You might need antiviral medicines to treat your <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span>. Antiviral medicines can make the illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. They also can prevent serious <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> complications. They usually work best when you start taking them within 2 days of getting sick.</p>Can the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> be prevented?<p>The best way to prevent the <span class=\"qt0\">flu is to get a flu</span> vaccine every year. But it's also important to have good health habits like covering your cough and washing your hands often. This can help stop the spread of germs and prevent the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span>.</p><p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p>"

      "Flu viruses spread from person to person primarily through tiny droplets produced when someone with the flu coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of nearby people. Less commonly, infection can occur by touching a surface or object contaminated with the flu virus and then touching one's own mouth, nose, or eyes.\n",

      "*   Cough\n",
      "*   Sore throat\n",
      "*   Runny or stuffy nose\n",

      "**How is the flu different from a cold?**\n",
      "*   **Onset:** Flu symptoms usually start suddenly, while cold symptoms develop slowly.\n",
      "*   **Fever:** Fever is common with the flu, but rare with a cold.\n",
      "*   **Aches:** Body aches are usual with the flu, but generally slight or absent with a cold.\n",
      "*   **Fatigue/Weakness:** Fatigue is common and often significant with the flu, but usually mild with a cold.\n",
      "*   **Headache:** Headaches are common with the flu, but rare with a cold.\n",
      "*   **Stuffy nose, sneezing, sore throat:** These are common with colds but only sometimes occur with the flu.\n",
      "\n",
      "*(Note: \"Stomach flu\" is a different illness called gastroenteritis, not influenza.)*\n",
      "\n",
      "**What other problems can the flu cause?**\n",
      "Sometimes, the flu can lead to complications, some of which can be serious or life-threatening:\n",
      "*   Bronchitis\n",
      "*   Ear infection\n",
      "*   Sinus infection\n",
      "*   Pneumonia\n",
      "*   Inflammation of the heart (myocarditis), brain (encephalitis), or muscle tissues (myositis, rhabdomyolysis)\n",
      "The flu can also worsen chronic health problems, like triggering asthma attacks in people with asthma.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Who is at higher risk for complications?**\n",
      "*   Adults 65 and older\n",
      "*   Pregnant women\n",
      "*   Children younger than 5\n",
      "*   People with chronic health conditions (e.g., asthma, diabetes, heart disease)\n",
      "\n",
      "**How is the flu diagnosed?**\n",
      "Diagnosis involves reviewing your medical history and symptoms. Tests can confirm the flu virus using a swab from the inside of your nose or the back of your throat. Rapid tests give results in 15-20 minutes but may be less accurate than other tests that take one to several hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What are the treatments?**\n",
      "Most people recover on their own with rest and avoiding contact with others (except for medical care). If you have flu symptoms and are in a high-risk group, or if you are very sick, contact your healthcare provider. Antiviral medicines may be prescribed, which can lessen severity, shorten illness duration, and prevent serious complications. They work best when started within 2 days of getting sick.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Can the flu be prevented?**\n",
      "The most effective way to prevent the flu is to get an annual flu vaccine. Good health habits, like covering your coughs and washing your hands frequently, also help stop the spread of germs.\n"
