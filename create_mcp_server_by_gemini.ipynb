      "Okay, here is a detailed explanation of the flu (influenza) based on information from MedlinePlus:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is the flu?**\n",
      "The flu, also known as influenza, is a respiratory infection caused by viruses. Millions of Americans get sick with the flu each year. While it often causes mild illness, it can sometimes be serious or even deadly, particularly for individuals over 65, newborns, and those with certain chronic health conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What causes the flu?**\n",
      "The flu is caused by influenza viruses that spread from person to person. When an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, they release tiny droplets containing the virus. These droplets can be inhaled by people nearby. Less commonly, infection can occur by touching a surface or object contaminated with the flu virus and then touching one's own mouth, nose, or possibly eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What are the symptoms of the flu?**\n",
      "Flu symptoms typically come on suddenly and may include:\n",
      "*   Fever or feeling feverish/chills\n",
      "*   Cough\n",
      "*   Sore throat\n",
      "*   Runny or stuffy nose\n",
      "*   Muscle or body aches\n",
      "*   Headaches\n",
      "*   Fatigue (tiredness)\n",
      "*   Some people, especially children, may also experience vomiting and diarrhea.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How is the flu different from a cold?**\n",
      "While symptoms can overlap, there are key differences:\n",
      "*   **Onset:** Flu symptoms usually appear suddenly, whereas cold symptoms develop slowly.\n",
      "*   **Fever:** Fever is common with the flu, but rare with a cold.\n",
      "*   **Aches:** Body aches are usual with the flu, but typically slight or absent with a cold.\n",
      "*   **Fatigue:** Fatigue and weakness are characteristic of the flu, but less common with a cold.\n",
      "*   **Headache:** Headaches are common with the flu, but rare with a cold.\n",
      "*   **Stuffy nose, sneezing, sore throat:** These are common with colds, but only sometimes occur with the flu.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also important to note that \"stomach flu\" is gastroenteritis, not influenza.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What other problems can the flu cause?**\n",
      "Some individuals may develop complications from the flu, which can be serious or life-threatening. These include:\n",
      "*   Bronchitis\n",
      "*   Ear infection\n",
      "*   Sinus infection\n",
      "*   Pneumonia\n",
      "*   Inflammation of the heart (myocarditis), brain (encephalitis), or muscle tissues (myositis, rhabdomyolysis).\n",
      "\n",
      "The flu can also worsen chronic health problems, like triggering asthma attacks in people with asthma. Those at higher risk for complications include adults 65 and older, pregnant women, children younger than 5, and people with chronic conditions like asthma, diabetes, and heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How is the flu diagnosed?**\n",
      "Diagnosis usually involves a medical history review and assessment of symptoms. Tests can confirm the diagnosis. A swab is taken from the inside of the nose or the back of the throat and tested for the flu virus. Rapid tests provide results in 15-20 minutes but are less accurate than other tests that may take one to several hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What are the treatments for the flu?**\n",
      "Most people recover on their own without specific medical care. Those with mild cases should stay home and avoid contact with others (except for seeking medical care).\n",
      "However, if you have flu symptoms and are in a high-risk group, or if you are very sick or concerned, you should contact a healthcare provider. Antiviral medications might be prescribed. These drugs can lessen the severity and duration of the illness and help prevent serious complications. They are most effective when started within two days of symptom onset.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Can the flu be prevented?**\n",
      "The most effective way to prevent the flu is to get an annual flu vaccine. Good health habits, such as covering your cough and washing your hands frequently, are also important to help stop the spread of germs and prevent infection.\n"
