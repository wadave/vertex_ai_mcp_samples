    "## Overview\n",
    "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that simplifies how AI assistants connect with external data, tools, and systems. It achieves this by standardizing the way applications provide contextual information to Large Language Models (LLMs), creating a vital interface for models to interact directly with various external services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developers building MCP-enabled applications have the flexibility to utilize existing third-party MCP servers or implement their own custom server solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on the latter, demonstrating how to build custom MCP servers using Gemini 2.5 Pro. We will walk through code generation and testing for four specific examples:\n",

    "#### MCP server code generation:\n",
    "- Example 1: Building a BigQuery MCP Server\n",
    "- Example 2: Building a MedlinePlus MCP Server\n",

But it can also be serious or even deadly, especially for people over 65, newborn babies, and people with certain chronic illnesses.</p>What causes the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span>?<p>The <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> is caused by <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> viruses that spread from person to person. When someone with the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> coughs, sneezes, or talks, they spray tiny droplets. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby. Less often, a person may get <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> by touching a surface or object that has <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.</p>What are the symptoms of the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span>?<p>Symptoms of the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> come on suddenly and may include:</p><ul><li>Fever or feeling feverish/chills</li><li>Cough</li><li>Sore throat</li><li>Runny or stuffy nose</li><li>Muscle or body aches</li><li>Headaches</li><li>Fatigue (tiredness)</li></ul><p>Some people may also have vomiting and diarrhea.

Some of these complications can be serious or even life-threatening. They include:</p><ul><li>Bronchitis</li><li>Ear infection</li><li>Sinus infection</li><li>Pneumonia</li><li>Inflammation of the heart (myocarditis), brain (encephalitis), or muscle tissues (myositis, rhabdomyolysis)</li></ul><p>The <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> also can make chronic health problems worse.

People with mild cases of the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> should stay home and avoid contact with others, except to get medical care.</p><p>But if you have symptoms of <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> and are in a high risk group or are very sick or worried about your illness, contact your health care provider. You might need antiviral medicines to treat your <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span>. Antiviral medicines can make the illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. They also can prevent serious <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> complications. They usually work best when you start taking them within 2 days of getting sick.</p>Can the <span class=\"qt0\">flu</span> be prevented?<p>The best way to prevent the <span class=\"qt0\">flu is to get a flu</span> vaccine every year. But it\\'s also important to have good health habits like covering your cough and washing your hands often.

      "[agent]: Okay, here's a detailed explanation of the flu (influenza) based on information from MedlinePlus:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is the flu?**\n",
      "The flu, also known as influenza, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It affects millions of people each year. While it often causes mild illness, it can sometimes lead to serious complications or even death, particularly in vulnerable populations like individuals over 65, young children, and those with chronic health conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What causes the flu?**\n",
      "Flu viruses spread primarily from person to person through tiny droplets produced when someone with the flu coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can be inhaled by people nearby. Less commonly, infection can occur by touching a surface or object contaminated with the flu virus and then touching one's own mouth, nose, or eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What are the symptoms of the flu?**\n",
      "Flu symptoms typically appear suddenly and can include:\n",
      "*   Fever or feeling feverish/chills\n",
      "*   Cough\n",
      "*   Sore throat\n",
      "*   Runny or stuffy nose\n",
      "*   Muscle or body aches\n",
      "*   Headaches\n",
      "*   Fatigue (tiredness)\n",
      "*   Some people, especially children, may experience vomiting and diarrhea.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's sometimes confused with the common cold, but flu symptoms usually start suddenly, fever and aches are more common and intense, and fatigue is often more pronounced. What's commonly called \"stomach flu\" is actually gastroenteritis, a different illness.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What other problems can the flu cause?**\n",
      "The flu can lead to complications, some of which can be serious:\n",
      "*   Bronchitis\n",
      "*   Ear infections\n",
      "*   Sinus infections\n",
      "*   Pneumonia\n",
      "*   Inflammation of the heart (myocarditis), brain (encephalitis), or muscle tissues (myositis, rhabdomyolysis)\n",
      "*   It can also worsen chronic health problems, such as triggering asthma attacks in people with asthma.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certain groups are at higher risk for complications: adults 65 and older, pregnant women, children younger than 5, and people with chronic conditions like asthma, diabetes, and heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How is the flu diagnosed?**\n",
      "Diagnosis usually involves a review of your medical history and symptoms. Tests can confirm the diagnosis. A swab is taken from the inside of your nose or the back of your throat and tested for the flu virus. Rapid tests provide results quickly (15-20 minutes) but may be less accurate than other tests that take one to several hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What are the treatments for the flu?**\n",
      "Most people recover on their own with rest and by avoiding contact with others. However, if you belong to a high-risk group, are very sick, or concerned about your illness, you should contact a healthcare provider. Antiviral medications may be prescribed. These drugs can lessen the severity and duration of the illness and help prevent complications. They are most effective when started within two days of symptom onset.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Can the flu be prevented?**\n",
      "Yes. The most effective way to prevent the flu is by getting an annual flu vaccine. Good health habits, such as covering your coughs and sneezes and washing your hands frequently, also play a crucial role in stopping the spread of germs and preventing flu infections.\n"
